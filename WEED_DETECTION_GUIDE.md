# üåæ Weed Detection vs Vegetation Detection

## The Problem

**Your original code detected ALL vegetation (crops + weeds), not specifically weeds!**

This means you would spray herbicide on your valuable crops too! üö´

## Methods Comparison

### ‚ùå NDVI Method (Simple Vegetation)
```python
# Detects ALL green plants
ndvi = (green - red) / (green + red)
mask = ndvi > threshold
```
**Result:** Detects crops + weeds + any green vegetation
- ‚úó Not suitable for selective herbicide spraying
- ‚úì Good for overall field health monitoring

### ‚úÖ Weed-Specific Methods

#### 1. **Color + Size Filtering** (Recommended)
```python
# Detect weeds by:
# - Broader color range (yellow-green to brown)
# - Smaller size (30-3000 pixels)
# - Excluding uniform bright green (crops)
```
**Best for:** General purpose weed detection

#### 2. **Texture-Based Detection**
```python
# Weeds have irregular patterns
# Crops have uniform texture
```
**Best for:** Dense plantings, harder to distinguish by color

#### 3. **Row Crop Method**
```python
# Detect crop rows
# Everything between rows = weeds
```
**Best for:** Row crops (corn, soybeans, vegetables)

## Updated Code Structure

### preprocessing.py
- `compute_ndvi_from_bgr()` - Vegetation index
- `detect_weeds_by_size_color()` - **Weed-specific**
- `detect_weeds_texture_based()` - **Weed-specific**
- `detect_weeds_by_row_crops()` - **Weed-specific**

### segment_stub.py
Methods available:
- `'ndvi'` - Simple vegetation (NOT weed-specific) ‚ö†Ô∏è
- `'color'` - Weed detection by size + color ‚úì
- `'size_filter'` - Enhanced morphological weed detection ‚úì
- `'texture'` - Pattern-based weed detection ‚úì
